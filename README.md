## Title: PIMA INDIANS DIABETES - UCI MACHINE LEARNING REPOSITORY
## Abstract
This dataset has been used to predict an onset of Diabetes in a sample of poulation of Pima Indians. xGboost algorith has been used to perform Binary classification.
The test data set has is 33% of the total data. This produced an accuracy of 77% on the test data.
